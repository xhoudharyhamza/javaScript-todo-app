# JavaScript Todo App using LocalStorage API

I create a todo app in JavaScript using localStorage API. The localStorage object allows you to save key/value pairs in the browser. We can access the localStorage by using different methods. By using the localStorage the todos are permanently stored in browser localStorage. Even if you close the app the todos will remain there and you will see todos every time you run the app.
#### Save Data to Local Storage
``` 
localStorage.setItem(key, value)
```
#### Read Data from Local Storage
``` 
let data = localStorage.getItem(key)
 ```
#### Remove Data from Local Storage
```
localStorage.removeItem(key);
```
#### Remove All (Clear Local Starage)
``` 
localStorage.clear();
```
